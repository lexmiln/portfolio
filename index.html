                    As a marketing&nbsp;experiment, in early 2015 Intuary spent
                    a few weeks rapidly building small, free apps for kids and
                    parents. The key was, in not knowing what might succeed, to
                    build quickly and test early.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    My app proposal was an ideas box for parents looking for
                    ways to occupy their children. I built the app in two weeks
                    using Swift with help from Intuary's designer
                    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/paul.deleon.98"
                      >Paul De Leon</a
                    >.
                  </p>
                  <p>Fidget is my first Swift app.</p>
                  <p>
                    The app's content is managed in a CMS using Python and
                    Django. This enables Intuary's content team to add and
                    update activities, with those changes immediately reflected
                    in the app. It also makes Fidget's content
                    <a href="https://fidgetapp.com"
                      >accessible through the web browser</a
                    >, and thus indexable by Google.

                <p>A Unity experiment in procedural terrain generation.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>unity</li>

                  <p>
                    A weekend of hacking with Unity led to an unexpectedly
                    delightful result with an approximation of what you might
                    see looking out of a train window.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The experiment makes as much use of the Unity Editor as
                    possible. Terrain 'tiles' are defined using the Unity editor
                    and set into multiple 'layers', which move at different
                    speeds for a simple parallax effect. Tile markers indicate
                    where tiles should join to create a continuous landscape.
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    The engine generates new tiles "just in time" as the camera
                    moves, so that the landscape appears to go on forever while
                    only a few dozen sprites are ever on screen at once.

                    invited me to build a game with her about making it through
                    the darkest time of the year. I took the opportunity to
                    learn
                    <a href="https://unity3d.com/">the Unity game engine</a> for
                    the project.

                    created the art for the game.
                    <a href="http://www.ryanike.com/">Ryan Ike</a> composed the
                    music. I wrote the engine, programmed the levels and
                    designed and recorded the game's soundscape, of which I am
                    particularly proud.

                    Building the game required the extraction and manipulation
                    of hundreds of art assets, which Marsh sent to me in PSD
                    format. I automated the asset pipeline using Python and and

                    >, which I accomplished in just six weeks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The port meant the FarFaria app needed to support phones for
                    the first time. Judicious application of best practices
                    helped me build a lean, reliable and performant app that
                    supported all Android form factors from day 0.

                    At Intuary I frequently delivered new features by writing

                    maintain Intuary's entire tech stack, incorporating MongoDB,
                    Heroku, Rails, and readers on iOS, Android,

                    I managed my own and others' productivity by building
                    extensive tools to assist with development, including
                    linters, asset management tools, localization tools and
                    extensive build automation.

                    Alex Primavesi led the project and built the iOS version. I
                    assisted by building the Android version with help from

                    The app's user interface called for animated, drop-shadowed
                    bezier paths on top of large, detailed maps, at 60fps. To
                    achieve this on modest hardware I wrote a custom graphics
                    engine directly on top of OpenGL.

                    Zombies, Run was my first iOS app <b>and</b> first mobile
                    app. Following Season 1's incredible commercial success I
                    rewrote most of the app for Season 2, fixing the rookie
                    mistakes I made the first time around.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I led the expanding technical team at Six to Start as we
                    ported the game to

                  <p>
                    During Seasons 1 and 2, the app was purchased by millions of
                    players for prices between $4 and $8. Since Season 4
                    (released after I left the company), Six to Start has
                    transitioned the app to a freemium model, expanding the
                    player base even further.

                    At Edinburgh University I worked on the
                    <a href="http://www.tegola.org.uk/tegola-history.html"
                      >Tegola research project</a
                    >, a testbed of long-distance over-water wireless links
                    intended to bring high-speed internet access to remote
                    Scottish islands otherwise neglected by the broadband
                    revolution.

                    Over-water 802.11 radio signals are subject to a well-known
                    issue of "tidal fading". The portion of the signal that
                    reflects off the water sometimes interferes constructively,
                    and other times destructively, with the signal that travels
                    the direct route, depending on the height of the tide.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The signal frequency is also a factor in calculating the
                    relative phase of the direct and reflected signal. This
                    suggests an opportunity to mitigate the fade effect by
                    manipulating the frequency of the signal — a simple form of
                    cognitive radio.

                    while I was at university, initially as a technician, later
                    as Venue Technical Manager.

                  <p>
                    The box office ran on an aging single user Java application,
                    which was developing bugs and performance issues that nobody
                    knew how to fix.

                    I wrote a replacement box office system as a Python web
                    application with a clean HTTP API, to enable multiple
                    clients and for the first time,

                    The project was a huge success and we began offering
                    ticketing services for other performance societies at the
                    university.
